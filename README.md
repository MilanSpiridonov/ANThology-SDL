# ANThology-SDL

This is a game I did a while back, 
It makes use of the SDL framework, it's written in c++ and well..
...It's pretty bad 

It's main mechanic is the movement from Snake.
You play as an ant, that collects pages from a book,
in order to collect it's book collection,
soo.. ANThology 	ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘‰
